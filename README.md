# atomic-workflow-mcp

A ground-up rewrite of the previous project, `C:/_dev/atomic-workflow-plugin`. It starts very small and
grows one verified step at a time.

## Terms

- Session server: the MCP server of one Claude Code session. Claude Code starts one per session, over standard input
  and output, and stops it when the session ends.
- Repository server: one process per repository, shared by every session server that attaches to it. All worktrees of
  a repository share it.

## Phase 0

A Claude Code plugin with one skill, `/atomic-workflow`, and one MCP server that does nothing yet.

- Claude Code starts the session server of the plugin at the start of every session. A plugin cannot start an MCP
  server on the call of a skill, so the session server lies dormant instead: it offers the tool `activate` and nothing
  else.
- `/atomic-workflow` calls `activate`. The session server connects to the repository server, and launches it first
  when none runs.
- The address of the repository server is a named pipe on Windows and a Unix domain socket elsewhere, named after a
  hash of the common git directory. Only one process can listen on it, so two launches at the same time leave one
  repository server.
- The repository server counts its connections. It ends when the last session server leaves, or when no session
  server attaches in its first 10 seconds. No process id and no lock file is involved.
- The repository server starts through a short-lived launcher process. It so has no living parent, and Claude Code
  killing the process tree of a session server on Windows does not reach it.

## Layout

  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      manifest of the plugin

  dist/                           bundles, built by `npm run build` and committed
mcp/                              the MCP project: sources, configs and build
  src/                            sources of both servers
  scripts/build.main.ts           builds plugin/dist/
```

## Development

- Run `npm` and `npx` in `mcp/`.
- `npm run build` bundles `plugin/dist/`. `npm run typecheck` and `npx biome ci` check the sources.
- `claude --plugin-dir ./plugin` runs a session with the plugin loaded from the working copy.
